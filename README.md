# Game Modes explained

## Command and Control

Become a hacker by activating an enemy MCOM and therefore gain control over their reinforcement tickets. 
As long as you are alive as a hacker, you drain a certain amount of enemy tickets every second. 
So, run and hide or fight with your squad as hacker!

## Frontlines

Experience a mix of Conquest and Rush as you fight for chained control points in a tug-of-war frontline. 
Both teams fight for one objective at a time. 
Push the frontline towards the enemy and finally destroy their MCOMs to win.

## Conquest

Capture the sectors to control the field. 
Deplete the enemy's reinforcements to win.

## Capture the Flag

Get to the opposing flag to pick it up and carry it back to your base. 
A dropped flag will return to its base after a timeout (which can be faster if re-capturing the flag). 
The team stealing the most flags, wins the match.
